## Projects
- Cyber Security Home Lab: I was able to use a service call Virtual Box where I was able to create virtual machines and implent my security skills. I created an attack machine, a victim machine, a firewall, and an intrusion detection and intrusion prevention system. During the beginning of this process I creating subnets for LAN and then for the WAN. I made sure to keep the firewall, the victim machine and the ids/ips on the same network which was on the private network and I gave the host the public network.
